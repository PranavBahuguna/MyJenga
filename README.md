# About
This is an adaptation of a Unity project assignment I had worked on earlier. It parses a collection of school subjects grade data for a student and represents their mastery of them as Jenga blocks. Mastered and learned subjects are represented as stone and wood blocks respectively, while subjects that are yet to be learned are represented as glass. In the app, we can select a tower and test it, which will remove all the glass blocks. This is intended to demonstrate the importance of properly learning more fundamental subjects in order to learn more complicated subjects.

In addition to testing towers, the user can also right click on a block to view more details on it. As shown in the screenshot, this will display more info about the particular subject in a pane on the top-right hand section of the screen.

This project is for demo purposes only, and I do not intend on extending this any further.
